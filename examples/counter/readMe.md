In this example, we design a counter as a SystemC module. It takes as input clock, reset, enable signals and return a 4-bit unsigned value. This example includes a bash script to help compiling the design. Syntax: ./compile.sh name_of_sc_file name_of_output_file. The following images depicts the simulation in the terminal:
